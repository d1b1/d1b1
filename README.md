### Hello All ðŸ‘‹

I am serial entrepreneur, hacky code writer and tech solution follower. I love 
good tech. I love a well written libraries that make building new things fun.

Currently in love with the work on the Platformatic.dev team and their 
work to lower the challenges of code-ownership by setting up new patterns
that cut way down on boilerplate.
