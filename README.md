### Hello All ðŸ‘‹

I am serial entrepreneur, hacky-coder and tech solution follower. I really love the fusion of new solutions and disruptive patterns. Currently geeking out on the work on the [Platformatic](http://Platformatic.dev) team and their vision to lower the challenges of code-ownership by removing boilerplate code from APIs.

Just left a startup, and looking for something new. Very interested in the fusion of capital/wealth and web technologies to spedd up outcomes in research & healthcare. ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I want to make an impact.

Also exploring the world of no-code, low-code solutions and patterns. âš¡ Thinking about how much code+time I could have saved in my last company if I had coded less and reused more. Dreaming of tech startup built 95% on no-code patterns.
